	{\em Mentor: Robert Owen}

	Developed a new approach to solve the PDEs needed to embed 2-surfaces into 3-Euclidean space.

	Implemented our algorithm in a finite-difference C++ code \& in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC).

	Ran binary black hole merger simulations, gaining insight into the behavior of horizon embeddability.
